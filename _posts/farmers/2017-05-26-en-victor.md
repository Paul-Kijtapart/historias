When I completed sixth grade, I went to Guatemala City to study music - saxophone and piano - for two years. I was able to be part of a marimba band. I got married and started working with a coop in Magdalena. Along with my father, I learned to farm brocoli, snow peans, and zucchini. 

Through the years, I was invited to be part of a peach project, a new crop that I never worked for. Being a governmental project, we got training for years. We would go sell to the local market. 
Recently I was asked from SI (Students International) to be part of avocado project. While learning about this crop, I found that has two harvest in a year and that can help me sustain my family. When I worked with peach, I was able to see that I can sustain my family. I believe that it will be the same with avocado. I love to see how I learn and excel in new things.
